# Fancy Button One - Interactive Button Component with Framer Motion

This repository contains an interactive and visually appealing button component built using **React** and **Framer Motion**. The "Fancy Button One" component demonstrates smooth animations on hover and click events, providing a modern and dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Hover Animation**:
  - When the user hovers over the button, it scales up slightly.
  - The background divs rotate dynamically to create a layered effect.

- **Click Animation**:
  - On click, the button and its background layers shrink and align perfectly, with all rotations resetting to `0`.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The button and its layers are styled using **Tailwind CSS**, making it adaptable to different screen sizes and designs.

- **Spring Transition**:
  - All animations leverage Framer Motion's spring transitions, ensuring smooth and natural movement.

## Key Technologies

- **React**: For building the component's structure and managing states.
- **Framer Motion**: For handling complex and seamless animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive layout.

## How It Works

### Hover Interaction
- The `motion.div` and `motion.button` detect hover events using `onHoverStart` and `onHoverEnd`.
- The button scales up (`scale: 1.1`), and the background layers rotate slightly.

### Click Interaction
- The button detects click events using `onClick` to toggle its state.
- On click, the layers behind the button animate to align (`top: 17px`, `rotate: 0`) while the entire structure shrinks (`scale: 1`).

### Customizable Styles
- The component uses Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.
- Modify classes or animation parameters to fit your design.
